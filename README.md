# Data Analysis Class

Welcome to the Data Analysis Class repository! This project serves as a comprehensive learning resource for mastering Python, starting from the absolute basics and progressing to data analysis with Pandas.

## 📚 Chapters

The course is structured into chapters, each covered by specific Python scripts.

### Chapter 1: Python Basics
Introduction to Python syntax, variables, and user interaction.
- **`class1.py`**: Covers basic printing, input/output, and variable types (strings, integers, floats).
- **`class2.py`**: Demonstrates a simple calculator and capturing user details.

### Chapter 2: Control Flow
Making decisions in your code.
- **`class8.py`**: Explains conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.

### Chapter 3: Data Structures
Organizing data efficiently.
- **`class3.py`**: Introduces Lists and Dictionaries, along with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### Chapter 4: Loops & Functions
Automating tasks and writing reusable code.
- **`class4.py`**: Uses `while` and `for` loops to create a student registration system.
- **`class5.py`**: Demonstrates how to define functions to build a modular calculator.

### Chapter 5: Data Analysis with Pandas
Working with real-world data.
- **`class6.py`**: Introduction to the `pandas` library, including loading CSV files (`read_csv`), data inspection (`info`, `describe`), and basic cleaning.
- **`class7.py`**: Advanced data analysis techniques such as grouping (`groupby`), pivot tables, handling missing values, and correlation analysis using `numpy`.

## 🚀 Usage

To run any of the scripts, make sure you have Python installed. You can run a file using the command:

```bash
python <filename>.py
```

For example:
```bash
python class1.py
```

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pandas` library (for Chapter 5)
- `numpy` library (for Chapter 5)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```

Happy Coding!
